Imports and Setup:

Various libraries are imported for data handling, machine learning, and plotting:
os, numpy, pandas for general operations.
yfinance for fetching stock data.
tensorflow and keras for building and training the LSTM model.
MinMaxScaler from sklearn for normalizing data.
matplotlib for plotting graphs.

Function Definition:
get_stock_data(stock_symbol, start_date, end_date):
Fetches historical stock data using yfinance for the specified symbol and date range.

Data Fetching:

get_stock_data is called with user inputs to fetch the historical stock data.
Data Validation:

Checks if any data was returned for the provided stock symbol and date range. If no data is found, a message is displayed, and the script ends.
Data Preprocessing:

The 'Close' prices are scaled using MinMaxScaler to normalize them between 0 and 1.
Training datasets X_train and y_train are created:
X_train: Contains sequences of prediction_days (60) previous closing prices.
y_train: Contains the closing price immediately following each sequence in X_train.

Model Building:

A Sequential LSTM model is built with the following layers:
LSTM layer with 50 units and return sequences enabled (for stacked LSTM layers).
Dropout layer with a 20% dropout rate (to prevent overfitting).
Another LSTM layer with 50 units (without return sequences).
Another Dropout layer.
Dense layer with 1 unit to predict the next closing value.
The model is compiled using the 'adam' optimizer and 'mean_squared_error' loss function.
Model Training:

The model is trained on X_train and y_train for 25 epochs with a batch size of 32.
Future Price Prediction:

The last prediction_days of scaled data are used as the initial input to predict future prices.
A loop predicts future stock prices for the number of days specified by the user.
The predicted values are appended to future_predictions and used as the next input in the loop.
Inverse Transformation:

The predicted future prices are transformed back to their original scale using scaler.inverse_transform.
Generate Future Dates:

A date range starting from the last known date is generated for plotting the future predictions.
Plotting:

A plot is created to visualize the actual and predicted stock prices.
The actual prices (for the most recent known days) are plotted in blue, and the predicted future prices are plotted in red.
The plot includes titles and labels for clarity
